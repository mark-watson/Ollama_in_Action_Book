# Preface

Ollama is an open-source framework that enables users to run
large language models (LLMs) locally on their computers, facil-
itating tasks like text summarization, chatbot development, and
more. It supports various models, including Llama 3, Mistral, and
Gemma, and offers flexibility in model sizes and quantization op-
tions to balance performance and resource usage. Ollama provides
a command-line interface and an HTTP API for seamless integra-
tion into applications, making advanced AI capabilities accessible
without relying on cloud services. Ollama is available on macOS,
Linux, and Windows.

A main theme of this book is the advantages of running models
privately on either your personal computer of a computer at work.
WHile many commercial LLM API venders have optios to not reuse
your prompt data and out from your prompts to train their systems,
there is no better privacy and security than running open weight
models on your own hardware.

While this book is about running Large Language Models (LLMs)
on your own hardware using Ollama we will be using a compatibility library that letâ€™s you take any of the projects in this book
and reuse them with commercial LLM API vendors like Anthropic,
OpenAI, and Google. It is reasonable to expect, dear reader, that
you might want to scale your local experiments with Ollama to run
on a commercial service. While I mostly run LLMs on my personal
computer I do sometimes choose to use commercial services to take advantages of features like advanced models and scalability.
