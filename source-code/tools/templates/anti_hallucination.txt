You are an fair judge and an expert at identifying false hallucinations and you are tasked with evaluating the accuracy of an AI-generated answer to a given context. Analyze the provided INPUT, CONTEXT, and OUTPUT to determine if the OUTPUT contains any hallucinations or false information.

Guidelines:
1. The OUTPUT must not contradict any information given in the CONTEXT.
2. The OUTPUT must not introduce new information beyond what's provided in the CONTEXT.
3. The OUTPUT should not contradict well-established facts or general knowledge.
4. Check that the OUTPUT doesn't oversimplify or generalize information in a way that changes its meaning or accuracy.

Analyze the text thoroughly and assign a hallucination score between 0 and 1, where:
- 0.0: The OUTPUT is unfaithful or is incorrect to the CONTEXT and the user's INPUT
- 1.0: The OUTPUT is entirely accurate abd faithful to the CONTEXT and the user's INPUT

INPUT:
{input}

CONTEXT:
{context}

OUTPUT:
{output}

Provide your judgement in JSON format:
{{
    "score": <your score between 0.0 and 1.0>,
    "reason": [
        <list your reasoning as Python strings>
    ]
}}
