# LLM Tool Calling with Ollama

TBD update for file layout for examples

I wrote a separate Python library that contains the tools used in this book. You can clone the repository for my Ollama book examples using:

```
git clone https://github.com/mark-watson/OllamaEx.git
```

You can put the following in your project's **requirements.txt** file to use this library:

```
git+https://github.com/mark-watson/OllamaEx.git
```

Currently this library supplies the following tools:

- tool_file_contents.py
- tool_file_dir.py
- tool_sqlite.py
- tool_web_search.py
- tool_summarize.py
- tool_judge_results.py
- tool_llm_eval.py

The last two tools listed will be discusses in the next chapter **Automatic Evaluation of LLM Results**

You should also clone the GitHub repository that contains most examples in this book:

```
git clone https://github.com/mark-watson/Ollama-book-examples.git
```

The source file **ollama_tools_examples.py** contains simple examples of using these tools. In this source file we first import these tools:

```python
from ollama_tools.file_dir import list_directory
from ollama_tools.file_contents import read_file_contents
from ollama_tools.web_search import uri_to_markdown

# Map function names to function objects
available_functions = {
    'list_directory': list_directory,
    'read_file_contents': read_file_contents,
    'uri_to_markdown': uri_to_markdown,
}
```

We will now look at examples using these tools.

```python
# User prompt
user_prompt = "Please list the contents of the current directory, read the 'requirements.txt' file, and convert 'https://markwatson.com' to markdown."

# Initiate chat with the model
response = ollama.chat(
    model='llama3.1',
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': user_prompt}],
    tools=[list_directory, read_file_contents, uri_to_markdown],
)

# Process the model's response
for tool_call in response.message.tool_calls or []:
    function_to_call = available_functions.get(tool_call.function.name)
    print(f"{function_to_call=}")
    if function_to_call:
        result = function_to_call(**tool_call.function.arguments)
        print(f"Output of {tool_call.function.name}: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"Function {tool_call.function.name} not found.")
```

Here is sample output from using these three tools (most output removed for brevity and blank lines added for clarity):

```
$ python ollama_tools_examples.py

Please not that the text extracted from a web page is almost plain text. Section heads are maintained but the format is changed to markdown format. In the last (edited for brevity) listing, the HTML *H1* element with the text **Fun Stuff** is converted to markdown:
