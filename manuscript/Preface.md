# Preface

Ollama is an open-source framework that enables users to run
large language models (LLMs) locally on their computers, facilitating tasks like text summarization, chatbot development, and more. It supports various models, including Llama 3, Mistral, and Gemma, and offers flexibility in model sizes and quantization options to balance performance and resource usage. Ollama provides a command-line interface and an HTTP API for seamless integration into applications, making advanced AI capabilities accessible without relying on cloud services. Ollama is available on macOS,
Linux, and Windows.

**A main theme of this book is the advantages of running models privately on either your personal computer or a computer at work.**
While many commercial LLM API venders have options to not reuse
your prompt data and the output generated from your prompts to train their systems,
there is no better privacy and security than running open weight
models on your own hardware.

This book is about running Large Language Models (LLMs)
on your own hardware using Ollama we will be using both the Ollama Python SDK library’s native support for passing text and images to LLMs as well as this library’s OpenAI API compatibility layer that let’s you take any of the projects you may already run using OpenAI’s APIs and port them easily to run locally on Ollama.

To be clear, dear reader, although I have a strong preference to running smaller LLMs on my own hardware, I also frequently use commercial LLM API vendors like Anthropic,
OpenAI, ABACUS.AI, GROQ, and Google to take advantages of features like advanced models and scalability using cloud-based hardware.

## Why Should We Care About Privacy?

Running local models using tools like Ollama can enhance privacy when dealing with sensitive data. Let's delve into why privacy is crucial and how Ollama contributes to improved security.

Why is Privacy Important?

Privacy is paramount for several reasons:

- Protection from Data Breaches: When data is processed by third-party services, it becomes vulnerable to potential data breaches. Storing and processing data locally minimizes this risk significantly. This is especially critical for sensitive information like personal details, financial records, or proprietary business data.
- Compliance with Regulations: Many industries are subject to stringent data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. Running models locally can help organizations maintain compliance by ensuring data remains under their control.
- Maintaining Confidentiality: For certain applications, like handling legal documents or medical records, maintaining confidentiality is of utmost importance. Local processing ensures that sensitive data isn't exposed to external parties.
- Data Ownership and Control: Individuals and organizations have a right to control their own data. Local models empower users to maintain ownership and make informed decisions about how their data is used and shared.
- Preventing Misuse: By keeping data local, you reduce the risk of it being misused by third parties for unintended purposes, such as targeted advertising, profiling, or even malicious activities.

### Security Improvements with Ollama

Ollama, as a tool for running large language models (LLMs) locally, offers several security advantages:

- Data Stays Local: Ollama allows you to run models on your own hardware, meaning your data never leaves your local environment. This eliminates the need to send data to external servers for processing.
- Reduced Attack Surface: By avoiding external communication for model inference, you significantly reduce the potential attack surface for malicious actors. There's no need to worry about vulnerabilities in third-party APIs or network security.
- Control over Model Access: With Ollama, you have complete control over who has access to your models and data. This is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data security.
- Transparency and Auditability: Running models locally provides greater transparency into the processing pipeline. You can monitor and audit the model's behavior more easily, ensuring it operates as intended.
- Customization and Flexibility: Ollama allows you to customize your local environment and security settings according to your specific needs. This level of control is often not possible with cloud-based solutions.

It's important to note that while Ollama enhances privacy and security, it's still crucial to follow general security best practices for your local environment. This includes keeping your operating system and software updated, using strong passwords, and implementing appropriate firewall rules.
