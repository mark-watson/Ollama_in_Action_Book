# Setting Up Your Computing Environment for Using Ollama and Using Book Example Programs

TBD: I am changing the layout of example programs - fix this chapter later.


There are several GitHub repositories that I have prepared for you, dear reader, to both support working through the examples for this book as well as hopefully provide utilities for your own projects.

You need to **git clone** the following repositories:

- [https://github.com/mark-watson/Ollama_Tools](https://github.com/mark-watson/Ollama_Tools): contains tools I have written in Python that you can use with Ollama.
- [https://github.com/mark-watson/Ollama_Utils](https://github.com/mark-watson/Ollama_Utils): contains utilities I wrote to avoid repeated code in the book examples.
- [https://github.com/mark-watson/Ollama-book-examples](https://github.com/mark-watson/Ollama-book-examples): examples for this book.
